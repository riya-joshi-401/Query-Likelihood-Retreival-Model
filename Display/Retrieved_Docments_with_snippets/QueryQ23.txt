----------------------------------------------------
a data STRUCTURE for manipulating priority queues 
a data STRUCTURE is described which can be used 
for representing a collection of priority queues 
the primitive operations are insertion deletion 



CACM-3113
----------------------------------------------------
optimal conversion of extended entry 
decision tables with general cost criteria 
a general dynamic programming ALGORITHM for converting 
limited extended or mixed entry decision 



CACM-3118
----------------------------------------------------
a common internal organization of bubble memories consists of a set of minor 
permutation of data blocks in a bubble memory 
loops connected through another major loop the problem of obtaining any 
give n permutation of the minor loop contents in minimum time is studied 



CACM-3121
----------------------------------------------------
derivation of more complex source to source transformations are also 
syntactic source to source transforms and program manipulation 
syntactic transforms are the source to source program transformations 
and semantic source to source transformations may be used for 



CACM-3127

thoth a portable real time operating system 
thoth isa real time operating system which is designed to be portable 
over a large set of machines it is currently running on two minicomputers 
with quite different architectures both the system and application
