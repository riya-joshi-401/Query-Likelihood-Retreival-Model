computing connected components on parallel computers 
we present a parallel algorithm which uses n2 processors to find the connected 
components of an undirected GRAPH with n vertices in time o log2n an 
o log2n time bound also can be achieved using only n n log2n processors

such that the value of the termination function is repeatedly reduced 
ordering is used to prove the termination of production systems 
a common tool for proving the termination of programs is the well founded 
the values of the program variables into some well founded set
