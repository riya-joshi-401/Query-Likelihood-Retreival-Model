oshb binary search tree is presented the ALGORITHM operates in time 
o log n where n is the number of nodes in 
time o log 2n moreover the o log n complexity is optimal earlier 
also be performed in o log n time thus the result of this paper

progressive acyclic digraphs a tool for DATABASE integrity 
a progressive acyclic digraph pad ALGORITHM accepts are requests and 
maintains a graph in an acyclic state when a request creates a cycle 
nodes are detached until the new are can be entered acyclically

organization eliminating the need for the recognition of region boundaries 
the approximation of polygonal thematic maps by cellular 
each segment is examined only once the versatility of 
approximation of polygonal maps by cellular maps 



CACM-3166
----------------------------------------------------
four ALGORITHMS for the numerical computation 
of the standard deviation of unweighted sampled DATA 
and computational literature the other two are new ALGORITHMS 
of the ALGORITHMS one new one old are substantially more accurate 



CACM-3167
----------------------------------------------------
updating mean and variance estimates an improved method 
a method of improved efficiency 
is given for updating the mean and variance of weighted sampled DATA 
when an additional DATA value is included in the set evidence
