on improving the worst case running time 
of the boyer moore string matching algorithm 
it is shown how to modify the boyer moore string matching algorithm so that 
its worst case running time is linear even when multiple occurrences of the

oshb binary search tree is presented the algorithm operates in time 
o log n where n is the number of nodes in 
time o log 2n moreover the o log n complexity is optimal earlier 
also be performed in o log n time thus the result of this PAPER

progressive acyclic digraphs a tool for database integrity 
a progressive acyclic digraph pad algorithm accepts are requests and 
maintains a graph in an acyclic state when a request creates a cycle 
nodes are detached until the new are can be entered acyclically
