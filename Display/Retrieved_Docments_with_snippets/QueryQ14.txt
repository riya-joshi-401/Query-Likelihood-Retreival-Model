----------------------------------------------------
ALGORITHMS towards the description of the properties of the packages 
and objects with which we build this paper analyzes some of the 
leading to basic changes in the nature of programming current programming 
systems of the complexity called for by the tasks we attempt just 



CACM-3151
----------------------------------------------------
an OPTIMAL real time ALGORITHM for planar convex hulls 
an ALGORITHM is described for the construction in real time of the 
convex hull of a set of n points in the plane using an appropriate DATA 
structure the ALGORITHM constructs the convex hull by successive 



CACM-3152
----------------------------------------------------
the technique of strassen to the reorganized DATA the reorganization block 
the transpose of one of the matrices is available at no additional cost 
makes possible the derivation of an asymptotically better bound 
in order to multiply matrices while minimizing 



CACM-3153
----------------------------------------------------
expected response times as functions of the control parameters 
studied the object is to investigate the effect of the memory 
the possibility of giving different quality of service to jobs of different 
the control of response times in multi class
