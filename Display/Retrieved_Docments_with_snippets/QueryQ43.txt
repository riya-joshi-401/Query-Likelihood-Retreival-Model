the technique of strassen to the reorganized data the reorganization block 
the transpose of one of the matrices is available at no additional cost 
makes possible the derivation of an asymptotically better bound 
in order to multiply matrices while minimizing 



CACM-3153

expected response times as functions of the control parameters 
studied the object is to investigate the effect of the memory 
the possibility of giving different quality of service to jobs of different 
the control of response times in multi class

determines the meaning of the algorithm whereas the control 
which specifies the knowledge to be used in solving problems 
and a control component which determines the problem solving 
strategies by means of which that knowledge is used the logic component

computing connected components on parallel COMPUTERS 
we present a parallel algorithm which uses n2 processors to find the connected 
components of an undirected graph with n vertices in time o log2n an 
o log2n time bound also can be achieved using only n n log2n processors
