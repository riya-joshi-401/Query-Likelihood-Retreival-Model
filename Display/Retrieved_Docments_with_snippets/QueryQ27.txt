to move each expression directly to the entrance of the outermost 
information or restrictions on the shape of the program graph 
linear with the size of the program and that it leads 
the elimination of redundant computations and the moving of invariant

thoth a portable real time OPERATING SYSTEM 
thoth isa real time OPERATING SYSTEM which is designed to be portable 
over a large set of machines it is currently running on two minicomputers 
with quite different architectures both the SYSTEM and application 



CACM-3128
----------------------------------------------------
examples of its use are given the relationship of the mechanism 
to control the ordering of events directly rather than using mutual 
ordering of events in the processes 
exclusion to protect manipulations of shared variables that control 



CACM-3129
----------------------------------------------------
optimal storage allocation for serial files 
a computer SYSTEM uses several serial files the files reside on a 
direct access storage device in which storage space is limited records are 
added to the files either by jobs in batch processing mode or by on line

----------------------------------------------------
SYSTEM from the perspective of the end user the making evident the effect of 
a methodology for the design of distributed information SYSTEMS 
describes the major costs of using an information 
of an interactive transaction processing SYSTEM
