the cyclic order property of vertices as an aid in scene analysis 
a cyclic order property is defined for bodies bounded by smooth curved faces 
the property is shown to be useful for analyzing pictures of such bodies 
particularly when the line data extracted from the pictures are imperfect

algorithms towards the description of the properties of the packages 
and objects with which we build this paper analyzes some of the 
leading to basic changes in the nature of programming current programming 
SYSTEMS of the complexity called for by the tasks we attempt just

expected response times as functions of the control parameters 
studied the object is to investigate the effect of the memory 
the possibility of giving different quality of service to jobs of different 
the control of response times in multi class

determines the meaning of the algorithm whereas the control 
which specifies the knowledge to be used in solving problems 
and a control component which determines the problem solving 
strategies by means of which that knowledge is used the logic component
