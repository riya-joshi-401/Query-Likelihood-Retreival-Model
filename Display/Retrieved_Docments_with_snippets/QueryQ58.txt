on improving the worst case running time 
of the boyer moore string matching ALGORITHM 
it is shown how to modify the boyer moore string matching ALGORITHM so that 
its worst case running time is LINEAR even when multiple occurrences of the

progressive acyclic digraphs a tool for database integrity 
a progressive acyclic digraph pad ALGORITHM accepts are requests and 
maintains a graph in an acyclic state when a request creates a cycle 
nodes are detached until the new are can be entered acyclically

organization eliminating the need for the recognition of region boundaries 
the approximation of polygonal thematic maps by cellular 
each segment is examined only once the versatility of 
approximation of polygonal maps by cellular maps

four ALGORITHMS for the numerical computation 
of the standard deviation of unweighted sampled data 
and computational literature the other two are new ALGORITHMS 
of the ALGORITHMS one new one old are substantially more accurate

updating mean and variance estimates an improved method 
a method of improved efficiency 
is given for updating the mean and variance of weighted sampled data 
when an additional data value is INCLUDED in the set evidence
