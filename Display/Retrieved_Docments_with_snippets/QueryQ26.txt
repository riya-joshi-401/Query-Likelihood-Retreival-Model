CACM-3105
----------------------------------------------------
a language extension for expressing constraints on data access 
controlled sharing of information is needed and 
desirable for many applications and is supported 
in OPERATING SYSTEMS by access CONTROL MECHANISMS this 



CACM-3106
----------------------------------------------------
a fast algorithm for copying list structures 
an algorithm is presented for copying an arbitrarily 
linked list structure into a block of 
contiguous storage locations without destroying the original 



CACM-3107
----------------------------------------------------
generating beta variates with nonintegrel shape parameters 
a new rejection method is described for generating 
beta variates the method is compared with 
previously published methods both theoretically and through 



CACM-3108
----------------------------------------------------
as the lengths of the strings increase the extra cost 
small compared to the lengths of the strings 
string transmission delimiters commas encoding of the integers 
economical encoding of commas between strings 



CACM-3110
----------------------------------------------------
whose lengths depend on the distance from a given 
instance of such an instruction to the operand of that 
instruction this paper considers the problem 
of minimizing the lengths of programs for such machines
