the cyclic order property of vertices as an aid in scene analysis 
a cyclic order property is defined for bodies bounded by smooth curved faces 
the property is shown to be useful for analyzing pictures of such bodies 
particularly when the line data extracted from the pictures are imperfect

an optimal real time algorithm for planar convex hulls 
an algorithm is described for the CONSTRUCTION in real time of the 
convex hull of a set of n points in the plane using an appropriate data 
structure the algorithm constructs the convex hull by successive

computing connected components on parallel computers 
we present a parallel algorithm which uses n2 processors to find the connected 
components of an undirected graph with n vertices in time o log2n an 
o log2n time bound also can be achieved using only n n log2n processors

such that the value of the termination function is repeatedly reduced 
ordering is used to prove the termination of production systems 
a common tool for proving the termination of programs is the well founded 
the values of the program variables into some well founded set
