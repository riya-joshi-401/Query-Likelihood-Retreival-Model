CACM-3151
----------------------------------------------------
an optimal real time algorithm for planar convex hulls 
an algorithm is described for the construction in real time of the 
convex hull of a set of n points in the plane using an appropriate DATA 
structure the algorithm constructs the convex hull by successive 



CACM-3152
----------------------------------------------------
the technique of strassen to the reorganized DATA the reorganization block 
the transpose of one of the matrices is available at no additional cost 
makes possible the derivation of an asymptotically better bound 
in order to multiply matrices while minimizing 



CACM-3153
----------------------------------------------------
expected response times as functions of the control parameters 
studied the object is to investigate the effect of the memory 
the possibility of giving different quality of service to jobs of different 
the control of response times in multi class 



CACM-3154
----------------------------------------------------
determines the meaning of the algorithm whereas the control 
which specifies the knowledge to be used in solving problems 
and a control component which determines the problem solving 
strategies by means of which that knowledge is used the logic component
