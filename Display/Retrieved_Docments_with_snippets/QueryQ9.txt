a model for and discussion of multi interpreter SYSTEMS 
a multi interpreter SYSTEM is a SYSTEM in which programs execute 
by virtue of being interpreted by other programs which themselves may 
either be interpreted i e nested interpreters or run directly on

a model for automating file and program design in business application SYSTEMS 
this paper discusses a model for finding an efficient implementation of a 
business application SYSTEM whose logical specifications have been determined 
in advance the model views file and program design as a problem

----------------------------------------------------
is a problem of growing interest this paper describes an approach 
to DISTRIBUTED computing at the level of general purpose programming 
languages based on primitive notions of module message 
of particular languages and machines it appears to be useful for

the cyclic order property of vertices as an aid in scene analysis 
a cyclic order property is defined for bodies bounded by smooth curved faces 
the property is shown to be useful for analyzing pictures of such bodies 
particularly when the line data extracted from the pictures are imperfect

expected response times as functions of the control parameters 
studied the object is to investigate the effect of the memory 
the possibility of giving different quality of service to jobs of different
