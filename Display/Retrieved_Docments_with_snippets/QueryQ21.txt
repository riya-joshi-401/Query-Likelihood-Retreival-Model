----------------------------------------------------
a data structure for manipulating priority queues 
a data structure is described which can be used 
for representing a collection of priority queues 
the primitive operations are insertion deletion 



CACM-3110
----------------------------------------------------
whose lengths depend on the distance from a given 
instance of such an instruction to the operand of that 
instruction this paper considers the problem 
of minimizing the lengths of programs for such machines 



CACM-3113
----------------------------------------------------
optimal conversion of extended entry 
decision tables with general cost criteria 
a general dynamic programming ALGORITHM for converting 
limited extended or mixed entry decision 



CACM-3118
----------------------------------------------------
a common internal organization of bubble memories consists of a set of minor 
permutation of data blocks in a bubble memory 
loops connected through another major loop the problem of obtaining any 
give n permutation of the minor loop contents in minimum time is studied 



CACM-3127
----------------------------------------------------
thoth a portable real time operating system 
thoth isa real time operating system which is designed to be portable 
over a large set of machines it is currently running on two minicomputers 
with quite different architectures both the system and application
