expected response times as functions of the control parameters 
studied the object is to investigate the effect of the memory 
the possibility of giving different quality of service to jobs of different 
the control of response times in multi class

CACM-3156
----------------------------------------------------
computing connected components on parallel computers 
we present a parallel algorithm which uses n2 processors to FIND the connected 
components of an undirected graph with n vertices in time o log2n an 
o log2n time bound also can be achieved using only n n log2n processors 



CACM-3157

such that the value of the termination function is repeatedly reduced 
ordering is used to prove the termination of production systems 
a common tool for proving the termination of programs is the well founded 
the values of the program variables into some well founded set
