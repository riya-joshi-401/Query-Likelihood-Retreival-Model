a selective traversal algorithm for binary search trees 
the problem of selecting data items from 
a binary search tree according to a list of range 
conditions is considered the PROCESS of visiting a

in the tree moreover the method is optimal in 
results by hirschberg indicates that of the three basic 
in o logn operations where n is the number of nodes 
an optimal method for deletion in one sided height balanced trees

----------------------------------------------------
the purpose of this report is to present a 
new class of sufficient optimality conditions for 
pure and mixed integer programming problems some of 
the sets of sufficient conditions presented can

an interference matching technique for inducing abstractions 
a method for inducing knowledge by abstraction 
from a sequence of training examples is described 
the proposed method interference matching induces abstractions

incorporation of units into programming languages 
the issues of how a programming language might 
aid in keeping track of physical units feet 
sec etc are discussed a method is given for the
